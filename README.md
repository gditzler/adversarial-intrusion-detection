# Adversarial Intrusion Detection

This repository contains code for preliminary results on intrusion detection systems and the impact that adversarial samples have on these systems. Specifically, these codes evaluate causative and exploratory adversarial attacks against anomaly detection methods on popular cybersecurity tasks (e.g., [NSL-KDD](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html)). 

More information about the code will be posted as this project develops. 

# Generating the Results 

TBD.
